Aspiring to level up my career in technology, I recently completed the [MLH Prep Fellowship](https://fellowship.mlh.io/programs/prep), a challenging and immersive program designed to help aspiring software developers gain valuable skills and experience. In this blog post, I would like to share my journey through the fellowship, including how I got into the program, my experiences during the fellowship, and some tips for those who are interested to join this program in future.

## My Journey to Getting Accepted:

I had always been enthusiastic about contributing to open-source projects and engaging with different communities. From my second year of college, I started applying for various programs, including [Google DSC](https://developers.google.com/community/gdsc), [MLSA](https://studentambassadors.microsoft.com/), [MLH](https://fellowship.mlh.io/), and [GSOC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/). Coming to MLH, my first two attempts to get into it were unsuccessful. In one instance, my application was rejected, and in the other, the pod was already full. üíî

Determined to make it into the program, I decided to give it another try, and this time I was better prepared. I started early, keeping a close eye on the application deadlines and filling out the application as soon as it opened. In my application, I highlighted a backend project that I had **built from scratch** using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. I made sure to showcase my skills, experience, and enthusiasm for software development, and emphasized the **unique features** of my project that set it apart from others.

### The Interview Process:

After submitting my application, I was invited for two rounds of interviews. The first interview was a **Personal Interview** where the interviewer assessed if I fulfilled all the requirements to be in the fellowship. This round was **relatively easy**, but I made sure to have a good internet connection and good quality audio/video setup to avoid any technical issues that could lead to disqualification.

The second interview was a **Technical Interview** where I was asked to walk the interviewer through my code and answer questions about my project. Since **I had built the project from scratch**, I was able to confidently explain the code and answer the technical questions. The interview went smoothly, and I was able to showcase my skills and knowledge in software development.

Finally, after these interviews, I received the acceptance email! It was a moment of joy and excitement as my hard work and persistence paid off. üéâüéâ

## My Experience in the MLH Prep Fellowship:

The three weeks I spent in the program were the best three weeks of this year for me. I learned numerous things in a short period, and there were many exciting activities, including fun events, networking opportunities, and lightning talks.

One of the best things about the fellowship was being part of a pod of **15 members**, where everyone came from different cultures and backgrounds. We had participants from India, the USA, Nigeria, Spain, Canada and other parts of the world, which made the experience truly diverse and enriching. üåçüåéüåè

What's even more impressive is that there were only **2 batches** for MLH Prep, with a total of **25-30 participants** selected from across the globe. That speaks volumes about the **competitiveness of the program** and how privileged I felt to be among the few chosen for this incredible opportunity. It was a true honour to learn and grow alongside such a talented and diverse group of individuals. üåüüíª

We had **daily meetings** where we would share our progress on the projects we were working on. We worked on **two projects** during the fellowship. One was a portfolio website where I got to work with Jekyll and Ruby, and the other was a React-based application. We were asked to work on issues in a team, so it was more like **pair programming**. We also had **one-on-one meetings** where we discussed each other's progress and talked about future opportunities. Additionally, there were **lightning talks** every week, where someone from the pod would speak on an interesting topic, followed by **discussions** related to that topic.

One of the major challenges I faced during the MLH Prep Fellowship was **working with fellows from different time zones** üåê. However, this experience taught me valuable skills in communication and coordination which are essential in today's globalized world. Another challenge I encountered was **resolving merge conflicts** while collaborating on projects. Although it was initially daunting, it provided me with valuable insights into version control and team collaboration, enhancing my skills in software development.

The pod leader and organizers of the MLH Prep Fellowship were also incredibly supportive and provided guidance, feedback, and mentorship throughout the program. They created a positive and inclusive learning environment where we felt empowered to ask questions, seek help, and grow our skills.

By the end of the three weeks, I had not only gained technical skills in web development, but I had also learned important soft skills such as effective communication, teamwork, and time management. The experience gave me the confidence and motivation to continue pursuing my career in software development. üî•

## Tips for Those Interested in Joining the MLH Fellowship:

1. **Start early**: Don't procrastinate! ‚è∞ Keep an eye on those application deadlines and submit your application as soon as it opens. Remember, the early bird catches the üêõ, and you don't want to miss out on this amazing opportunity!
    
2. **Showcase your skills**: Highlight your skills and experience in your application. Be specific about the projects you have worked on, the technologies you are proficient in, and your passion for software development. Share any relevant achievements or contributions to open-source projects.
    
3. **Be original**: Avoid being a copycat! üö´ Show off projects that you have created from scratch, and let your creativity flow. Originality is the key to unlocking the doors of opportunity!
    
4. **Be prepared for interviews**: It's showtime! üé¨ Be ready to rock those technical and personal interviews. Practice your coding moves, prepare for those questions, and show them what you've got!
    
5. **Check your tech**: Interviews are online, so make sure you have a stable internet connection and good audio/video quality. Test your equipment beforehand to avoid any technical hiccups that could potentially lead to disqualification.
    
6. **Embrace rejections and learn from them**: Don't get discouraged by rejection, but rather see it as an opportunity to learn and grow. Reflect on feedback, identify areas for improvement, and come back stronger in your next attempt. Rejections are a part of the journey, and they can make you even more resilient and determined to succeed!
    

## Final Thoughts

In conclusion, the MLH Prep Fellowship was an incredible experience that provided me with valuable skills, connections, and memories. It was a stepping stone in my path to becoming a software developer, and I am grateful for the opportunity to have been part of this program. I encourage those interested in joining the MLH Prep Fellowship in the future to be proactive, embrace challenges, and make the most out of this unique opportunity. üöÄüöÄ
